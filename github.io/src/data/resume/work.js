    summary: `During my internship, I was responsible for training a state-of-the-art 
    text-to-speech model, *voicecraft*, in Traditional Chinese. This task was particularly 
    challenging due to the complexities of Chinese pronunciation compared to English and 
    other languages. I combined the work done by my colleagues with the new model, modifying setup 
    to make them compatible to each, and build an maintainable environment for further developments. 
    Overall, I gained experience in processing multimedia data and scheduling workflows from data 
    cleaning to model training. Additionally, I refactored the code to improve readability.`,
