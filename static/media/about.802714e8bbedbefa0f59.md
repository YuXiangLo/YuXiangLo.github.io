# Intro

I am currently a CS junior at National Taiwan University, where my academic and practical pursuits span a wide range of technologies. I have developed skills in front-end and back-end development, as well as in various branches of machine learning including deep learning and reinforcement learning. From September 2023 to April 2024, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html). I am currently advancing my machine learning capabilities as an intern at [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw), with a focus on music-based applications.

# Family Background

I live in Taipei, Taiwan. My father is a police officer, and I never totally know what my mom's work is. It's kind of like a consultant, but not **really a consultant**. He's a bit portly, incredibly funny, and an exceptionally good brother. I miss him sometimes. Hope he's thriving in his endeavors there.
