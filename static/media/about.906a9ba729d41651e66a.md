# Intro

I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at National Taiwan University, and I will soon begin my Master's program in the same field at the same institution. During my undergraduate studies, I explored a range of topics, including data mining, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, as well as web and game development. I have worked as a research assistant at the Institute of [Information Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html), and as a machine learning engineering intern at [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw). Recently, I co-authored a paper titled ToxicTone as the first author; the paper was accepted for presentation at Interspeech 2025.
