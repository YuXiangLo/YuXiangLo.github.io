# Intro

I am currently a senior in Computer Science at National Taiwan University, with a diverse range of skills spanning front-end and back-end development, as well as machine learning, including deep learning and a little bit reinforcement learning. From September 2023 to April 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Institute of [Information Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html), where I participated in research projects that enhanced my technical and analytical skills. I also completed an internship at [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw), focusing on music-based applications of machine learning, further advancing my expertise in this field.
